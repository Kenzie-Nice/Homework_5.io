photos dont turn around and honestly I can't figure out why even with chatGPT helping........truly confused. 

Looking at the final product, it’s clear there’s a bit more going on than I initially thought. The process of randomizing the images and setting up the arrays to make sure each one appears twice seems pretty complex when you break it down. It’s not just a matter of throwing the images into a grid—there’s some thought behind the way things are randomized and how the grid is displayed.

Compared to what I’ve done, I feel like this version has more layers of logic happening, like with the random placement and making sure the grid updates correctly when you click on an image. But at the same time, it still feels like it’s just the basics—images, clicks, and grids. I was kind of expecting a little more creativity in how it all comes together, but I get that this is just the foundation. I’m sure it’ll get more interesting when the matching part and attempts come into play.
